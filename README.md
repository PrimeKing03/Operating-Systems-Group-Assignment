## Summarised Assignment Description
In collaboration with a group, we conducted a critical analysis of a recent research paper on the Theseus operating system. Our study encompassed a range of topics including system hardware requirements, installation processes, user interfaces, process control, memory management, deadlock management, and disk scheduling. Together, we authored a detailed 2000-word report that summarized and compared key findings, meticulously adhering to the IEEE referencing format. Additionally, we prepared and delivered a comprehensive presentation during a viva session to showcase our analysis.
